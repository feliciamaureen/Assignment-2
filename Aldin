My name is Aldin Dervisevic and my student number is s3707846. I can speak four languages fluently, those 4 languages being English, Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. My highest level of education is year 12 VCE. My background is Bosnian, but I’m born and raised in Australia. I’m passionate about sports, with my favourite sport being basketball. My hobbies are playing basketball and listening to Bosnian music. Although I don’t have a specific area of interest in I.T, I enjoy using different kinds of technology/devices such as the internet and mobile devices. If I were to choose a favourite app, it would without a doubt be the messenger app, as I love the concept of being able to chat with friends in an instant, receiving notifications when a friend appears online and other cool features within the app. Currently, I have no experience in the I.T industry. However, hopefully after completing this bachelor, or maybe even during the bachelor, I would like to get a bit of experience working at an I.T company. I think this is important because it will give me an idea of what to expect in the real world, how to approach and it and it will also give me some idea of what I might do in the future.

Firstly, something as simple as making sure everyone has a copy of their results, is a good place to start. For instance, if you want to make a group/team of four, something that can be done is for those 4 people to share with each other their results, that way each member of the group, has an idea of what type of people they’re going to be working with. A benefit of this is that people can quickly look at other people’s results, which saves time compared to if everyone were to discuss about themselves. In addition, taking the results into consideration can help in terms of assigning tasks.

The mobile developer position requires you to be able to design and create mobile applications according to the customers/business needs. When creating these mobile applications, your goal is exceptional user experience, as you want nothing less but whoever is using your app to be able to do what they want, as smoothly as possible, minimizing problems. However, you also need to regularly check your apps and decide what are the positive and negative features of them, and how you can improve the applications. A key part to this is constantly seeking feedback from users, taking it into consideration and implementing it. You must be able to work collectively with others in groups.
