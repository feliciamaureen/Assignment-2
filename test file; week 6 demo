Facebook
key errors made:
- a loophole in the facebook security system that allowed data harvesting via a facebook based quiz by a third party developer
- data from facebook can be freely accessed and collected by third party developers
- users who gives third party apps consent to access their facebook automatically gives consent to give their data to third party developers, but users did not know that their data was private
how it can be avoided in the future
- implementing ‘privacy from day one’ on facebook’s end which has been advised to them for a long time (built in protection)
- limiting access to users’ personal data to ensure interconnections between platforms stay secure

Autonomous weapons
should they be banned?
- no
- they are able to replace humans in a battlefield scenario to reduce mortality rate
- however, they should not be deployed nor tested in a public scenario and should not be used until system is perfected
must there always be a human in the loop accountable?
- yes
- a robot no matter how much it ‘learned’ still has its autonomy made by a human. 
- a robot itself does not have conscience, making all of its actions decided by a system made for it by a human
- if we can easily blame robots for death and destruction, humans behind the creation of their systems will never be held accountable and their mistakes can be easily shaken off and there might not be improvements in making sure their creations do no harm.
how much autonomy should these machines have?
- these robots should not be fully autonomous; making sure all of them have a failsafe mechanism where a human can override their system if something gow


cybersecurity
what is a white hat hacker?
- an ‘ethical’ hacker 
- specialises in penetration testing in an organisation’s system
- finds weakest link in a system not to exploit, but to report and try to fix
should they be encouraged?
- yes
- they have the skills of a black hat hatter but they do not use it for exploitation, thus using their expertise to increase cybersecrity instead of breach it. 
- black hat hatters usually do what hey do for personal or financial gain. If white hat hackers are encouraged, less black hat hatters would be around due to them being able to do what they are good at in a way that can benefit other people.
