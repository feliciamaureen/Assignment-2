									<p>Cryptocurrencies are digital forms of assets, used as means of monetary currency exchange minus the physical aspect of traditional methods of currency trade. Although cryptocurrency does not physically exist anywhere, is is not without value and stands alone as a form of currency. Virtual currencies differ from traditional means of physical monetary exchange as they use alternate means of transaction approval to centralised economic banking systems and is much more efficient. Where banks act as the middleman in authorising and approving transactions in a centralised manner; cryptocurrencies secure their transactions via decentralised methods. All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded and encrypted on a public ledger called a blockchain; the blockchain is an openly accessible network, available to the public. It is not run by one institution or authority, nor run on a central server. Whilst this may sound like a potential privacy issue, it is actually more secure as these transactions are resistant to alteration or modifications. Given its decentralisation, transaction approval times are not limited to the rigid and inflexible working hours that banks are, so the oversight of transactions occur much faster. All transactions must be validated, this is done by members of the general public via the blockchain. Essentially, individuals use high powered computers that run equation solving software to help verify and timestamp all transactions as quickly as possible so they can be added to the blockchain. As a reward for verifying transactions, these individuals, called ‘miners’, are awarded portions of cryptocurrency for being the first to approve the transaction. </p>
									<p>Cryptocurrencies are viewed as groundbreaking technology as they add aspects of anonymity, unlike traditional centralised banking. Individuals are able to transact with nothing more than a 26-35 character alphanumeric key that acts as a ‘wallet’, with no ties to their name. Prospectively, cryptocurrencies can either collapse or the technology may be openly embraced and set the standard of modern monetary exchange. Their extreme efficiency meets the growing demands of modern productivity, and may see global reserve banks throughout the world establishing their own forms of cryptocurrency whereby traditional barriers inherent of these central banks are not limited to these transactions. This integration of cryptocurrencies into modern living may also see the end of physical forms of cash. </p>
									<p>In terms of physical use, there may be little difference between swiping a credit card linked to a bank account or tapping a phone linked to a cryptocurrency wallet; whilst providing the same cost efficiency and convenience as physical money. This cryptocurrency revolution will likely affect banks foremostly; however, large corporate retail conglomerates may be open to accepting cryptocurrencies as payment forms. Along with this revolution, countless jobs will be created as well as made redundant. On a personal level, cryptocurrencies may really only affect day to day individuals if retail giants begin to embrace the currency. Until then, as a full time student, I see no personal use I may have for digital cryptocurrencies. For now, it is likely cryptocurrencies will predominantly be used on a corporate level for investing purposes rather than mainstream transacting means. </p>
