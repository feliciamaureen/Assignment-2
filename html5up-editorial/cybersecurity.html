									<p>It is the practice of ensuring and maintaining integrity as well as confidentiality of information in systems, networks and programs from, and programs from digital attacks. The idea of security does not only encompass personal data you provide to social media and shopping sites, but it is also the act of protecting your devices whether it be your smartphone, laptop or router.</p>

									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Cybersecurity as a concept and field of study is mainly based on ensuring and maintaining the integrity as well as the confidentiality of information of systems from digital attacks. It is arranged in layers to protect the 3 main components of a person’s everyday computing, which includes cloud, network as well as the endpoint devices such as computers, smart devices, etc. Some common technologies currently used to protect these devices include DNS filtering, malware protection, antivirus software, email security solutions as well as next-generation firewalls.</p>
									<p>The layer division makes sure that if one wall of protection is broken, there are still several others that are protecting the data. But like an onion, more often than not if one layer is broken, it can cause many more tears, one leading to another. Though there are numerous layers, 7 of them encompasses protecting one’s company from afar, physical security of your devices, wireless security, passwords, using two-factor authentication, email security as well as antivirus.</p>
									<p>Nowadays, most cyberattacks rely on human error, such as phishing. Phishing scams are attempts of getting people to give out their personal information such as addresses, bank account numbers, passwords and credit card numbers. Phishing is common in emails, social media sites and instant messaging platforms where the targeted individual is given a fake website link to encourage them to give out personal information. Other attacks can be caused by black hat hackers trying to gain information for personal gain. These hackers find loopholes in a company’s security system to get data that they may sell for money or use themselves in criminal actions such as exploiting someone’s credit card information. </p>
									<p>There is a small number of people with security skills despite the need and demand in this area, which makes cost relatively high. Companies value efficiency and making the most out of a small value. However, the lack of people in this field may cause their skills to be expensive.</p>
									<p>As of today, most of the capital put into the security of a company’s data mainly focuses on protection and prevention. Company leaders want to balance risk, resilience, usability and price. But since events such as the Facebook leak, it can benefit companies and the public if their capital was to be shifted to detection, response and remediation. This way instead of acting after a leak or an attack, companies will have protocols put in to stop attacks and leaks before they can happen.</p>
									<p>With cloud maturing and AI developing, in the future, cybersecurity will live in a digital ecosystem to allow damage to be contained in the cyber space rather than to the physical world. There will be an increased need in the protection of cloud with more and more data stored there, but the usage of AI can allow security systems to learn and immediately act on attacks rather than having to wait for people to act, thus making most of the security of information partially self sustaining. </p>
									<p>However, even with companies implementing protocols and new technology to maintain the privacy and integrity of information, consumers on the other end of the story also needs to be informed and involved. Not many people are aware of their role in their own security as well as the threats targeted to them and how they can avoid giving out personal information, thus making education and transparency of companies a vital step moving forward.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>The further development of this technology will continue to create new jobs as security becomes more and more of a concern. Interest in this field of study will increase which will allow more people to want to become a part of the team of people maintaining the confidentiality of private data. There will also be an integration of operations and development making DevOps into DevSecOps, as running them as separate units can be inefficient. While with AI becoming more advanced and security being moved to a digital ecosystem, some tech can be made redundant as more tasks can be done with one device/team of people. But as time goes on, research will need to continue to keep up with the increased complexity of the attacks which at the end will keep needing more people in the field to contribute ideas and solutions. When security does become more and more self sustainable however, less attacks will go out of hand as more of them can be contained and handled quickly without having to involve real world casualties. </p>
									<p>People will continue learning from past leaks and will continue to educate themselves to ensure that they are in control of their own data and how it is being used. Companies will be more transparent with their consumers as to how their data is being protected as keeping the integrity of our data as a society must be a two way thing.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How will this affect me?</h2>
									<p>The effects of an improved cybersecurity system might not be as noticeable in everyday life, but in the long run, there will be less scandals regarding data leaks and violation of privacy. After the news of the Facebook leak, people will more likely be more concerned about their data in fear of their information getting passed around and will look into how they can ensure their own safety.</p>
									<p>Within a few years more and more companies will keep trying to patch their security protocols, this will be seen in the form of pop-ups and updates in apps, websites or other tech that will inform their users as to how their data is being kept safe and how us as consumers can play a role in our own safety. There will be more disclaimers and warnings when we are about to enter our data, but there will be more sophisticated scams floating about continuously trying to trick us. </p>
									<p>Our family and friends will be far more informed regarding how scams occur, how to avoid them as well as their rights and responsibilities when it comes to their data. Getting educated on the effects of giving consent to a third party app to access our data, or how companies are keeping our data safe in the first place can be a good starting point to ensuring we do not get exploited and not be able to do anything about it.</p>
