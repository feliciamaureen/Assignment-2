										<h1>IT Work</h1>
									</header>

									<p>To get a good idea of what it's like to work in the ever changing world of IT, we interviewed an IT professional to get a glimpse of what they go through.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>
									<p>My job title is a Technical Analyst and I support the SAP system, I write programs, enhance the SAP programs to support the business.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h2>
									<p>I work for the IT department of a Utilities company. There are many groups within the IT department. For e.g. Applications, Infrastructure, Desktop Support, Telecommunications.
										A lot of the Utilities industry use SAP ISU to support their business. ISU is an industry specific
										solution for managing Electricity, Gas and Water to read meters and bill the retailer. 
										We also use SAP ERP for Financial reporting, Payroll and Plant Maintenance to schedule and control the maintenance and construction business.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>
									<p>Working with other IT resources to solve problems for the business and provide technical solutions. Thereâ€™s a lot of automation, what we do automates a lot of manual tasks, for example, someone might do a tedious task, and they will ask me to create a program to do it, so they just enter the data instead.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h2>
									<p>I interact with fellow team members, team leaders, team members of other application support that our systems interface with. Dealing with external auditors, loading up programs and running them. Dealing with the business, telling you what their requirements are. Project managers.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>
									<p>We provide solutions and work through how we will approach a solution and we must document it and have meetings with the business as well.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h2>
									<p>I do not interact with customers or clients.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2>
									<p>I spend most time on coding.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>
									<p>Dealing with project managers, very concerned about time constraints, putting pressure on workers, must meet deadlines but these can vary depending on what problems we may encounter.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>
									<p>Provide IT solutions to improve relations with the customer and retailers. Provide efficient and accurate solutions to read meters and bill retailers for use.</p>
