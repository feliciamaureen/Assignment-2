									<p>
										Autonomous cars are the next big technology leap the world can make, but is the technology up to scratch, ensuring the safety of all individuals involved? Large companies such as Uber and Tesla have made big strides to achieve the perfect driverless car, creating technology more advanced than ever before, but recent events involving the death of a woman in America, seem to indicate this is not enough. Along with the many benefits, self-driving cars also come with a long list of problems, click here to read moreâ€¦

									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>
										An autonomous or self-driving vehicle can drive itself without user-input, instead, these cars can take input from their surroundings to get to its destination. The idea of a self-driving car has been around for years, but even with all the advancements made in technology, big companies were not able to create a car that was successful. In 2004, a competition was opened for any team around the world to create a self-driving car that had to drive for 228 kilometres and cross a finish line, the best car only made it 11km before failing. Another competition was started, more teams entered with newer technology. One vital piece of technology that was created was a special laser radar, called a lidar, which allowed the car to construct a 3D image of its surroundings to navigate around obstacles. Another car was created with special AI technology with it being able to learn, this car was not just doing what it was told but was also processing their surroundings and drawing on past events to make decisions and choose the safest route. Today, a more developed lidar is widely used among autonomous cars, without the development of this technology, these cars would not have the same power and intelligence that they do.
									</p>
									<p>
										There are many benefits to autonomous cars such as elderly and children having easier and sometimes safer access to transport. The potential for human error is eliminated, decreasing the amount of crashes. Furthermore, as these cars are software and electronically driven, they will reduce the amount of pollution released into the atmosphere. Reduction in traffic, as the cars will be able to communicate with each other and plan the best route as well as a reduction in emissions as these cars are run via electricity, not fuel. It will create more jobs within the IT industry, opening pathways for experts in the fields of developers and engineers. A major benefit is the amount of time that will no longer be wasted driving places, by using a driverless car, individuals will have more time to complete work, read a book, watch a movie or do countless other activities as they will not have to concentrate on driving, freeing up many hours per week per person.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, there is a long list of disadvantages to accompany this as well, such as liability in a crash, if an autonomous car makes a wrong decision, it cannot be legally held responsible, but should the makers of the car? As it would be their technology that malfunctions, or would it be the owner, as they are responsible for the actions that the car makes once they purchase it. For example, a test car run by Uber, in Arizona, USA, crashed into a woman crossing the street, killing her. Questions were asked as to whether the technology was safe enough to employ into daily life, as it was not able to register a human on the road, and the aftermath of who was responsible for the crash also came into question. As of Thursday the 29th of March, Uber reached a settlement with her family, but no blame was distinctly put on the company or the test car. Another disadvantage is the loss of jobs, such as taxi and Uber drivers will be put out of a job, as these autonomous cars will likely cost less for a trip as there is no driver required to pay a wage to.

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>
										The likely impact upon implementation of this technology, is greater mobility for a portion of the population which did not previously have this opportunity, such as children or the elderly. They would be able to get to their destinations without the use of public transport or bikes. This technology may make taxis redundant, as consumers will no longer need them for transport, putting a lot of drivers out of work. The petrol industry would also suffer as these cars are electronic, therefore the cars would no longer need fuel. These cars may also become another device for individuals to generate an income off, they could get their car to drop them off at work, then send it off to taxi people around and earn money, and then would return at the end of the day to take the owner back home.

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>
										In day to day life, an autonomous car would be able to drop my family and I off at my closest station, to get to work or university, eliminating the need for parking, cutting down travel time by at least 20 minutes. I would also be able to do last minute work on a 35-minute car ride into the city from my home or catch up on sleep if I went to bed late the night prior. Trips to the shops would be quicker as parking the car would not be needed. I would be able to send the car to act as a taxi for other people in need and make extra money whilst I work 8 or 9 hour shifts or am at university for the day.
