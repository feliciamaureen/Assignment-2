											<h3>Aldin Dervisevic</h3>
											<p>My name is Aldin Dervisevic and my student number is s3707846. I can speak four languages fluently, those 4 languages being English, Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. My highest level of education is year 12 VCE. My background is Bosnian, but I’m born and raised in Australia. I’m passionate about sports, with my favourite sport being basketball. My hobbies are playing basketball and listening to Bosnian music. Although I don’t have a specific area of interest in I.T, I enjoy using different kinds of technology/devices such as the internet and mobile devices. If I were to choose a favourite app, it would without a doubt be the messenger app, as I love the concept of being able to chat with friends in an instant, receiving notifications when a friend appears online and other cool features within the app. Currently, I have no experience in the I.T industry. However, hopefully after completing this bachelor, or maybe even during the bachelor, I would like to get a bit of experience working at an I.T company. I think this is important because it will give me an idea of what to expect in the real world, how to approach and it and it will also give me some idea of what I might do in the future.</p>

											<h3>Elisha Plessas</h3>
											<p>
												My name is Elisha Plessas, s3663327, I was born in Australia but am of European background, descendant of my grandparents who are native to greece. Ironically, i’m in my third year of an Applied science (psychology) bachelor's degree; however, am a student of an Information Technology class. Whilst I am unable to identify a specific interest in IT, I am, however, able to indistinctly recognise my interest in networking and development areas, whilst steering clear of anything coding related.

											<h3>Felicia Maureen</h3>
											<p>1. As of March 2018, this job of a JAVA developer, is ranked fairly high, being 7th out of 25 highest ranked jobs. However, a similar position of software developer is also present on the list, this is much lower, sitting at 19th. Furthermore, in May of 2017, a JAVA developer was significantly lower, and the software developer was at #2 on the list, indicating the demand for JAVA has increased, and the demand for software developers has decreased</p>
											<p>2a. Skills in JAVA is in very high demand for employers recently, and this skill is desired within this job, and React, which would be included in the JavaScript skill, is ranked 2nd. However, no other skills such as agile and XP practices or the programming language Go are in high demand.</p>
											<p>2b. Team work and collaboration and communication would be very important skills within this job and these are in the top 3 most in demand generic skills.  Creativity would also be an important skill as the developer would need to contribute ideas to making PaperCut efficient and sustainable. This is ranked number 9 out of 25 skills.</p>
											<p>2c. The top 3 IT skills not in my skillset are SQL, Microsoft Windows and project management</p>
											<p>2d. The top 3 generic skills not in my skillset are problem solving, organisational skills and writing</p>
											<p>3. My opinion of my ideal job has not changed, as many of the skills that are needed for this job are still in very high demand currently, languages such as JAVA and JavaScript are very universal therefore this job would allow me to learn as much about these as possible</p>

											<h3>Natalie Muhar</h3>
											<p>1. As of March 2018, this job is ranked quite low, 3rd from the bottom, with only 278, top job titles that are listed as developer. However, in May 2017, this was ranked first with 7,952, indicating the demand for this job has decreased.</p>
											<p>2a. Website production would be a vital skill in terms of working for Jora, this is ranked 17th in the top 25 skills most searched for. As for other important IT-specific skills, developing in ruby and ruby on rails, is not widely used in the field, the most important language is SQL and experience in search technologies is also not as common. Systems engineering may be useful in this job, and this skill is ranked 24th, however other skills such as deployment and use of infrastructure are not in high demand.</p>
											<p>2b. The most important generic skill for this job would be problem-solving, this is ranked 2nd out of 25 of high demand skills, indicating employers are mostly looking for people who are logical and can work through complex issues. Communication skills would also be very important as this job requires you to work in a team, this is ranked first.</p>
											<p>2c. The top 3 IT skills not in my skillset are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. These are all coding languages that seem to be very important within today’s technology.</p>
											<p>2d. The top 3 generic skills not in my skillset are organisational skills, writing and team work/collaboration</p>
											<p>3. Yes, my opinion on my ideal job has changed, as this job requires Ruby as the primary language, however other languages such as SQL, JavaScript and JAVA seem to be in higher demand, therefore it is more likely that more jobs would be looking for this skill, so I should be learning about these languages instead of Ruby which seems to be a rarer language.</p>
