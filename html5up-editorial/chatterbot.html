									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Natural Language processing is an area in the computer science field, which is about how computers/machines interact with human (everyday) languages, specifically, how to program computers or devices such as chatbots so that they’re able to process lots of human language data. In other words, a chatbot can be viewed as an interface which a human interacts with, and the technique the chatbot uses is called “natural language processing”, which is what enables it to have a conversation in the same language as the user.</p>
									<p>Natural language processing and chatterbots are becoming more common. A good example is Siri, which is found on iPhones and iPads. Essentially, Siri is a personal helper. You activate Siri by holding down the button on an iPhone, and then saying something. Siri listens to your input and processes it. Siri then speaks back to you, and also provides written text based on whatever you said or asked it. Not only is Siri capable of processing “human language”, but it’s also quite useful for having the ability to do other tasks like set reminders, alarms, call people and check the weather for you, making it a reliable personal assistant.</p>
									<p>Natural language processing allows humans to communicate effectively with machines. A good example is phone self-service machines, which are commonly used within retail, government services and banks. When you call a government service such as Centrelink, for instance, a machine will pick up your call and start to ask for your details like your customer access number. This is then followed by the machine asking you what’s the reason for your call, as this allows it to transfer you to a particular department, where an actual human will be speaking with you. A reason behind this may be that the people who work at Centrelink are far too busy to answer every single person’s call, hence the machine answers, collects the essential information, and puts people to wait until someone is available. Alternatively, it may also be the fact that the phone self-service is more cost-efficient in comparison to hiring and paying more employees to do the same thing.</p>
									<p>Some benefits of implementing these machines within an organisation are: they are quick, intelligent and direct customers to appropriate resources if they have specific queries. Also, something to consider is that unlike humans, machines don’t complain about working conditions such as long hours and pay. However, it’s important to remember that these machines are not flawless, as there may be cases where the machine may misinterpret what the person has said, which can lead to people becoming confused and frustrated at the same time.</p>
									<p>Bots are always changing and with no doubt will change in the near future. Currently, natural language processing technology such as self-service machines are able to engage with humans in a simple conversation and generally, are able to understand what is being said to them and know how to respond. However, when things start to get more complex, it may have difficulty responding to or helping a customer with their queries. For example, if a person wants to order food over the phone, but requests “gluten free” only, the machine may have trouble understanding this and knowing what to do, as it may have only been designed for simple conversation. One of the many ways in which bots will be evolving in the near future, is by creating bots which are capable of better reflecting complex ‘human language’ phrases, words and patterns.</p>

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>The likely impact of natural language processing and chatterbots is that many people may be left jobless and replaced by chatterbots. For example, people who work in retail, banking or similar industries where customer service is extremely important to a business’ success, are the ones who are most at risk. One of the reasons for this is the advantages associated with implementing natural language processing technology. This type of technology costs less than paying employees to perform customer service roles. Not only is this type of technology cost-efficient, but it’s also quick to answer, doesn’t show up to work late or complain about work conditions such as pay or long hours. It seems quite clear that when we take these things into account that these machines are a preferable choice over people. However, a problem this creates is that people are at risk of being replaced by machines, and if they are, what does this mean? Will employees need to prove they’re better than a machine in order to keep their position or will they simply be dismissed and be forced to find new jobs? Considering the current era in which we live in, finding a job is quite difficult, for people of various age groups, only making things harder for the upcoming generations. Currently, many businesses use chatbots, and it’s no surprise as they are inexpensive and provide many benefits. If future businesses follow this trend of technology, the potential impact may be that a large number of people will struggle to hold onto their jobs as they’re at risk of being replaced.</p>

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>This particular trend of technology has some level of impact on my daily life. This is because I often use natural language processing technology. For example, I use computer software such as Microsoft Word to complete my university work. Microsoft Word uses natural language processing and the way it does this is by detecting spelling and grammatical errors and providing solutions as to how to fix them, allowing you to correct any errors you make. This is quite relevant to me, as there are times where I’m required to write essays or reports, hence the natural language processing technique used by the Microsoft Word software is rather convenient. One of the things that I’ve noticed will be different as natural language processing and chatbots become increasingly popular is that many of the questions people have, are likely to be answered by machines, rather than people. </p>
									<p>It’s an unusual thought/idea, but when we consider the benefits associated with implementing these particular machines within businesses, then it seems like the chances of this happening will be high, which wouldn’t be a surprise to me. In regard to how my friends or family may be affected by this type of technology, one way may be the way they search for things. For instance, if my friend wanted to check the score of a basketball game on Google, rather than doing it the standard way of typing, he decides to use the voice search feature, something is which is becoming more popular. This applies to some iPhone users, who love interacting with Siri, as it’s capable of doing multiple things like calling people, setting reminders etc by using voice search, making it a popular choice. In short, natural language processing will affect me in my daily life, but only to a certain degree.</p>
