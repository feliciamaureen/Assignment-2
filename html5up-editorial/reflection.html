											<h3>Elisha Plessas</h3>
											<p>
												The effortless cohesion of our group enabled us to evenly distribute the workload between each member throughout the course of this assignment. Each individual within the group undertook an equal portion of the assignment with Felicia tackling the large task of designing the web page itself. We were able to comfortably consult and communicate with one another whenever we ran into difficulties and found it easy to help one another out. Each member of the group was available to contact whenever needed and were each consistently present during the tutorial class every week. The stream of communication we utilised as a group was Facebook messenger and would be the best indicator of work distribution rather than Github, as Github does not reflect the contributions made by Aldin and Natalie. The surprising thing for me is that in almost every group project I have participated in, there has always been a member unwilling to pull their own weight. This was not the case throughout this assignment as each member was willing to fulfill their own duties plus more. This assignment has restored my faith in group work and has enabled me to see the benefits of co dependent tasks.

											<h3>Felicia Maureen</h3>
											<p>
												Since the start of the project, our group has always been able to work together and communicate effectively. We had numerous ideas from each person, each were taken into account and we were able to use as many ideas as we could in our end product. We all did equal portions of the work and melded them well into one cohesive website. Though our Github does not accurately reflect our progress, each member contributed in their own way. Elisha and I tried to use Github as much as possible to continuously update the html pages for everyone to see, but Aldin and Natalie each did their work via Word and shared their progress through our Facebook group chat. Each of us attended all the tutorials to get together and discuss and we all compiled our work towards the end and polished our site with no issue. Though the last time I was required to create an assignment as a group with new people, some people would only talk and not work or not pull their weight, but this time around I was comfortable with my group mates and I think we all made something we were happy with.

											<h3>Natalie Muhar</h3>
											<p>
												I think this group worked well together, we all did our parts of the assignment thoroughly and sent them to Felicia who put them into the website. Everyone’s ideas were listened to and we were able to talk through who was doing which parts, and when I felt unsure about something, I always felt comfortable to ask someone for help. The work was divided up well and we all did equal parts of the assignment, and all had a fair say on how it should be presented on the website. I think GitHub reflects the work that Felica and Elisha were doing, but Aldin and I were just doing our work on Word for most of the Assignment and forgot that we needed to be adding to GitHub as we go in order to track how much we had contributed, therefore GitHub will not reflect our contribution. I think we worked quite well together, and I don’t think any improvements could be made.
