<h1>Elisha Plessas</h1>
									<h2>Personal Info</h2>
									<p>My name is Elisha Plessas, s3663327, I was born in Australia but am of European background, descendant of my grandparents who are native to greece. Ironically, i’m in my third year of an Applied science (psychology) bachelor's degree; however, am a student of an Information Technology class. Whilst I am unable to identify a specific interest in IT, I am, however, able to indistinctly recognise my interest in networking and development areas, whilst steering clear of anything coding related.<p>

									<h2></p> <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">Big Five</a> </h2>
									<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1c_reTdGQLh0nbGl0rgu1kk2cPdQjSWC3">

									<p>This test categorises behavioural tendencies within five fundamental personality traits. The results of the Big Five indicate that I am open minded, which may allow me to better engage with others within a team environment. I have a lack of conscientiousness which may present as an obstacle within my team, as my unreliability and disorganisation may hold me back from work submissions and deadlines, therefore letting not only myself down but my group. The test also states that I am inherently introverted which may also hold me back in terms of fulfilling my potential within a group context. This insight into my personality may be useful when establishing a group, as it would be in my best interest to form a group consisting of personalities that may complement facets of my own. As I am low in conscientiousness, perhaps forming a group consisting of high conscientiousness people will provide me with the structure and organisation I need.<p>

									<h2></p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Myers-Briggs</a></h2>
									<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gBltLY44AoczFdwYG5q8d_tiRPzbTYSM">
									<p>This tests classifies my personality at INFP; introverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving. Sensitivity, creativity and loyalty are just a few personality traits inherent of my personality type. It describes my personality as valuing freedom, choice and flexibility. Within a team environment, this may hold me back in that I may not have the creative freedom to fully express my ideas and fulfill my potential. It would be in mine and my teams best interest to coordinate with those who fall into the ‘open-mindedness’ personality type, and are willing to pursue any concepts I may put forward.<p>

									<p>Whilst information provided by this test may not be of direct insight into my personality, it identifies any malevolent connotations to my personality such as machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. Whilst I am quite low scoring in narcissism and psychopathy, I did indicate a higher result in machiavellianism which is the tendency to manipulate those around me. This may suggest certain behavioural tendencies I may be inclined to act out within a group context. For others in my group to take this test would provide some insight into the inner workings of these members of the team and potentially an explanation into group dynamics. In terms of member selection, it would be wise to steer clear of any high scorers on this test.<p>
								
								<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
								<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TVuxN60i2kaNz8tP2Z3ZyGxo6TtjocvI">
								
								
									<p>The position of ‘General Manager – Tech / Managed Services Company’ is a leadership position in the field of IT for a private organisation within western Sydney suburbs. Strong interpersonal communication skills are applied within a working environment in order to lead a team and direct this organisation. This senior role entails establishing business plans and budgets whilst overseeing staff duties. If for nothing else, the appealing salary package of 220K significantly interests me.<p>
									<p>A strong managerial background is required in order to be considered for this position. As well the ability to unite coworkers and employees based on exceptional communication skills. The candidate will have extensive experience in the technology industry and possess the commitment and values to see extensive growth in both the company’s revenue and market share.<p>
									<p>I have a long road ahead of me if I want to fit the criteria of this position. Whilst I may possess some of the necessary skills such as communication abilities, all other requirements of the job, I am severely lacking in; which I would come to expect from most university students. I have no experience in managerial positions, nor do I have a background in any IT work, unless you count an IT unit at university.<p>
									<p>If I want to come even close to being a viable candidate for this position, I need to graduate from university. Perhaps apply for graduate programs and positions and start an entry level position to further develop my communication skills and broaden my horizons whilst establishing connections. I’ll work hard and over time i’ll scale the ranks within the organisation and hopefully gain some experience in a managerial position. This will help to develop my leadership skills, and get a feel for working with and relying on others. With a lot of time and dedication perhaps one day I will be fully equipped to undertake a position as such.<p>
									<p>In contrast to my team member’s ideal job’s, my ideal job description is quite a senior role. Although the position is for a tech company, according to the job description, it is clear that it is not an IT focussed position so much as it is a general managerial one. Whilst Aldin’s job focus was in the field of application development, mobile apps to be specific; Natalie’s ideal job is more web interface oriented and Felicia’s is within software development. These are dramatic contrasts to my ideal job position in that whilst they all have the commonality of a general IT basis, they are all essentially completely different fields of work.<p>
