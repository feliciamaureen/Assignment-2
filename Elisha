Personal Info:
My name is Elisha Plessas, s3663327, I was born in Australia but am of European background, descendant of my grandparents who are native to greece. Ironically, i’m in my third year of an Applied science (psychology) bachelor's degree, being a student of an Information Technology class. Whilst I am unable to identify a specific interest in IT, I am, however, able to indistinctly recognise my interest in networking and development areas, whilst steering clear of anything coding related.

Team Profile:
Big Five:
This test categorises behavioural tendencies within five fundamental personality traits. The results of the Big Five indicate that I am open minded, which may allow me to better engage with others within a team environment. I have a lack of conscientiousness which may present as an obstacle within my team, as my unreliability and disorganisation may hold me back from work submissions and deadlines, therefore letting not only myself down but my group. The test also states that I am inherently introverted which may also hold me back in terms of fulfilling my potential within a group context. This insight into my personality may be useful when establishing a group, as it would be in my best interest to form a group consisting of personalities that may complement facets of my own. As I am low in conscientiousness, perhaps forming a group consisting of high conscientiousness people will provide me with the structure and organisation I need.

Myers-Briggs:
This tests classifies my personality at INFP; introverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving. Sensitivity, creativity and loyalty are just a few personality traits inherent of my personality type. It describes my personality as valuing freedom, choice and flexibility. Within a team environment, this may hold me back in that I may not have the creative freedom to fully express my ideas and fulfill my potential. It would be in mine and my teams best interest to coordinate with those who fall into the ‘open-mindedness’ personality type, and are willing to pursue any concepts I may put forward.

Dark Triad:
Whilst information provided by this test may not be of direct insight into my personality, it identifies any malevolent connotations to my personality such as machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. Whilst I am quite low scoring in narcissism and psychopathy, I did indicate a higher result in machiavellianism which is the tendency to manipulate those around me. This may suggest certain behavioural tendencies I may be inclined to act out within a group context. For others in my group to take this test would provide some insight into the inner workings of these members of the team and potentially an explanation into group dynamics. In terms of member selection, it would be wise to steer clear of any high scorers on this test.
